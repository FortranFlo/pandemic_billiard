# pandemic_in_a_box
A toy simulation of a pandemic based on particles in a box.

The HTML file, the CSS file and the Javascript file are commented a little bit. Have a look at them!

The simulation is pretty self-explaining. Every particle can be either uninfected (purple), infected (red), recovered(green) or dead (disapeared). Particle dynamics is controlled by the speed, size and number of particles. Recovery time is the time until the particle is no longer infectious and case fatality rate is the ratio between dead and infected particles. The simulation should react to changing the window size as well.
